    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>Thank you for being part of our community at Repro (hereafter: "Repro", "we", "our", "us"). We are committed to protecting your personal information and your right to privacy.</p>
    <p>When you use our devtools extension (the "Extension") or visit https://share.repro.dev (the "Sharing App"), you entrust us to collect and use your personal data responsibly. In this privacy notice, we explain what information we collect and how it is used.</p>

    <h3>What information do we collect?</h3>

    <h4><em>Browser session recordings</em></h4>
    <p>The core purpose of the extension is to facilitate the sharing of recorded browser sessions and user activity (including mouse movements, key presses, and similar). This data remains on your local device until you voluntarily upload a fully encrypted recording to our storage backend.</p>
    <p>Any recordings that you upload to be viewed on the sharing app are encrypted on your local device before transmission. The encryption key is not transmitted with the recording, nor stored by us at any time. We have no means to read or process any recording data that you upload.</p>
    <p>Recordings are stored anonymously, with no link or reference to any account data or identifiable information.</p>

    <h4><em>Usage data and product analytics</em></h4>
    <p>In order to better understand how the extension and sharing app are used, we track a small amount of usage data. This data includes interactions with features, but does not contain any identifiable information.</p>

    <h3>How do we use your information?</h3>

    <h4><em>Browser session recordings</em></h4>
    <p>We do not read or process this data at any time. This data remains encrypted during receipt, storage and transmission. This data - which may or may not include personally identifiable information (depending on the contents of the recording) - is only viewable by those in possession of the encryption key: you and other parties that you choose to share this with.</p>

    <h4><em>Usage data and product analytics</em></h4>
    <p>We use aggregated analytics to inform our product development. This data is shared with a trusted third party (Mixpanel), who act as the data processor for this information.</p>

    <h3>Age restrictions</h3>
    <p>The extension and sharing app are not intended to be used by anyone under the age of 18.</p>
